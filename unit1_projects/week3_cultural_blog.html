			<div class="post">
				<p>The first official phase of DBC began three weeks ago for me, and I have been extremely impressed with not only the curriculum, but also with how much I have been able to learn in such a short amount of time. The focus of the first three weeks has been on the presentation components of web development: HTML, CSS, and Javascript. While I was initially eager to move on to the back end (Ruby, Rails, SQL, etc.), I have found myself enjoying building my own static sites and experimenting with design elements. However, I have also found myself comparing my work to my classmates' work quite frequently. And that scares me.</p>
				<p>Since I began learning web development on my own last fall, I have been immersed in the process. I have had only myself to worry about, and without a clear destination or end point, I have been completely absorbed in the journey. However, now that I am a part of DBC, I not only have a specific date on my calendar of when I should begin applying for new jobs, but I also have names, faces, and work to compare myself too. These names and faces are actual people who I will be spending the next several months of my life with. We are expected to collaborate, give feedback, and bond, but I'm nervous that I will be unable to see anyone as more than a competitor for potential employment opportunities.</p>
				<p>I'm aware that this isn't a desirable or healthy approach to DBC, but I was somewhat to relieved to hear that I wasn't the only one with this fear. When watching Shereef's fireside chat, someone asked exactly what I had been thinking: "How competitive is the culture at DBC?"</p>
				<p>Shereef paused, but gave a somewhat reassuring answer. In essence, he admitted that students do come in with a competitive mindset, but due to the large number of open developer positions and the welcoming culture of DBC, there is not much reason to feel threatened by or to compete with classmates. He also said that the instructors work very hard to help everyone become vulnerable, put fears aside, and work on becoming the best person they can be.</p>
				<p>I'm looking forward to becoming more vulnerable; I believe this quality can help improve much more than my career. I have already become better at viewing work from others within my cohort and using what I see to learn and improve my own work. However, I still can't shake the feeling that I will feel like a failure when and if my classmates are moving faster than I am or are offered jobs while I can't land interviews. I suppose this is a rational fear, and I am encouraged that DBC is already working to combat this.</p>
				<p>Shereef suggested that everyone come to DBC with the attitude that they are going to get the absolute most out of the experience that they can. I am hungry for improvement, and I already love the work that I am doing. I believe if I stay focused on myself, it will become natural to support my classmates and open myself up to lean and grow from everyone around me. That's my goal at least, and I am genuinely excited to meet everyone in person come June!</p>
