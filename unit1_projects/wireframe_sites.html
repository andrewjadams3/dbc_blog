		<a href="http://reddit.com" target="_blank"><h2>Reddit</h2></a>
		The goal of reddit is to display the most popular links on the internet in one place. To do this, reddit has a very simple and minimalistic design. The main actions available on the front page are searching links, creating links, and most importantly, reading links.

		<a href="http://engadget.com" target="_blank"><h2>Engadget</h2></a>
		Engadget tries to provide as many links to articles as possible. Anything the site thinks you may find interesting is shown to you as soon as you open the site. This makes the site feel cluttered, but allows the user to engage with a large amount of content.
