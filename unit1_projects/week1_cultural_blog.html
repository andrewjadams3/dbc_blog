            <span class="article-heading">Leadership</span><br/>
            There have been several times in my life where I have been unexpectedly placed in leadership roles, both musically and professionally. Before any of these experiences, I was introverted, soft-spoken, and had little self-confidence. However, I quickly learned how to speak and act confidently while still maintaining the ability to consult others and process feedback. I believe it is because of this that I have been successful as a teacher, and why I use the leadership skills that I have developed and learned to help my students have greater confidence in themselves.<br/><br/>
            <span class="article-heading">In general, I try to live up to these values:</span><br/>

            <span class="article-heading">What was the last topic that someone asked for your advice on?</span><br/>
            I recently had a student ask me for advice on choosing a major and career path in college. There were mostly concerned about setting themselves up to have an enoyable career and college experience. My advice to them (as someone who was beginning the process of changing careers) was to not worry. I advised them to pick a subject they felt like they enjoyed and could be successful in, and commit themselves to learning everything they could about that subject. If they later decide to change majors or careers, they will have a solid foundation of work ethic and achievements to build on. Most importantly, I told them not to focus so much on where they are headed, but rather enjoy the experience of learning.
