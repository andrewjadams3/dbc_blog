            For this week's technical blog, I have been tasked with analyzing three of my favorite websites in terms of user experience and design. The three websites I have chosen (<a href="http://engadget.com" target="_blank">Engadget</a>, <a href="http://udacity.com" target="_blank">Udacity</a>, and <a href="http://reddit.com" target="_blank">Reddit</a>), are distinctly different, and each is designed with a different goal in mind.<br/><br/>

            <span class="article-heading"><a href="http://engadget.com" target="_blank" title="Engadget">Engadget</span><br/>
            <img class="post-image" src="http://api.webthumbnail.org?width=250&height=200&screen=1024&url=http://www.engadget.com/"/></a>
            Engadget is a technology blog which focuses on new gadgets and consumer electronics. This is one of my favorite sites due to the quality of articles and the wide number of topics covered on a daily basis. When looking at the homepage, your eye is immediately drawn to the collection of featured articles at the top of the page. There are often eye-catching images associated with each of these articles. The site does feel cluttered at times due to the large number of images, links, and advertisements. However, I find it fairly easy to navigate, and the articles are quite readable.<br/><br/>

            After browsing the site for a while, you can easily get sucked into reading post after post. The sidebar highlights anything current and popular, and related articles are shown right before the comments section. However, because the content is interesting and informative, you do leave with a greater sense of knowledge and a feeling of being up-to-date. Although it is somewhat obvious that the site does everything it can to get you to stay and keep reading, I believe the design is successful. Engadget is both visually pleasing and practical.<br/><br/>

            <span class="article-heading"><a href="http://udacity.com" target="_blank" title="Udacity">Udacity</span><br/>
            <img class="post-image" src="http://api.webthumbnail.org?width=250&height=200&screen=1024&url=http://www.udacity.com/"/></a>
            Udacity is an online education platform which features a selection of free and paid <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/STEM_fields" target="_blank">STEM</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Massive_open_online_course" target="_blank">MOOCs</a>. The homepage generally serves to inform a first-time user what Udacity provides and how it operates. Following popular models, information is presented alongside interesting javascript animations as you scroll down the page. Several "course catalog" buttons stick out, and direct you to a list of courses which are categorized by content area.<br/><br/>

            While the homepage catches your attention, the best design features of the site can only be experienced when participating in a course. Each lesson is broken down in to multiple, short videos which are hosted on YouTube and embedded in the center of the page. As you watch each video, you can track your progress (and skip around in the lesson) by following a progress bar at the top of the page. There are also a number of short quizzes in each lesson which replace the video when necessary. Instructor notes are provided at the bottom, and questions relating to each individual video are displayed on the right, alongside links for you to ask your own questions.<br/><br/>

            The incredible amount of interactivity coupled with the ease-of-access to relevant resources helps Udacity stand out as one of the premier MOOC platforms. I have taken a number of courses through the site and have had wonderful experiences with each one. The design of the site allows any instructor to create and present a course in a manner that is familiar and natural to a student. As an educator, I believe in the model that they have developed, and I hope to make similar contributions to education in the future.<br/><br/>

            <span class="article-heading"><a href="http://reddit.com" target="_blank" title="Reddit">Reddit</span><br/>
            <img class="post-image" src="http://api.webthumbnail.org?width=250&height=200&screen=1024&url=http://reddit.com"></a>
            Reddit is a website about everything! Users of the site can submit links which are then voted up or down by other members. Anyone can create a community ("subreddit") in which related links can be submitted. Every link features comments, and users can gain "karma" by having their submissions or comments voted up.<br/><br/>

            The homepage is extremely simplistic, and features the top links from a default set of subreddits. Each link has a small thumbnail accompanied by a short description. Other than a list of links, a small navbar, and a few ads, the site looks pretty bare. However, this design is conducive to sharing only the most popular headlines in a compact manner.<br/><br/>

            While I enjoy browsing the Reddit, the site can be a huge time-waster. Although the format is great for sharing important, interesting, and breaking news stories, it also works well for sharing entertaining content with little substance. I often find myself browsing mindlessly, and have to make a conscious effort to leave. Despite the downsides, the site has proven itself to be effective and popular. Although the design initially appears outdated, Reddit achieves its goal of sharing the best links in an organized and efficient way.
