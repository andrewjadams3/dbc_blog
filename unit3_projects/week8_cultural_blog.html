			<h2 class="post-title">Week 8 Cultural Blog: Pairing & Feedback</h2>
			<div class="post">
				<p>The experience of pairing with other people these past 8 weeks has been diverse and interesting. It has really forced me out of my comfort zone in terms of how I complete my work. While I don't feel like I'm a controlling person, I do generally enjoy working alone and coming up with my own plans. Pairing with others doesn't allow for that type of work, and it has been an adjustment experimenting with different approaches. I have found that I understand problems better when I hear someone elses thought process, and speaking my thoughts out loud to another person helps me catch mistakes that I may have missed going at it alone. At the same time, I often feel slowed down and anxious because I am used to diving directly into the work. This isn't necessarily a bad thing because my speed can sometimes lead to careless errors. Overall, I have found pairing to be a positive and beneficial experience. I am looking forward to pairing more in person; hopefully many of the communication and workflow barriers that are imposed when pairing remotely will be removed.</p>
				<p>Although I never felt fully comfortable when pairing, I was relieved to see that almost all of the feedback provided to me was positive. Most stated that they felt relaxed when working with me, and that we struck a good balance between communication and work. The common theme in my actionable feedback seemed to be that I have a tendency to move quickly, which can lead to confusion in my partners. That is certainly in line with how I prefer to work, and heeding this feedback allowed me to ensure my partners and I were on the same page before proceeding.</p>
				<p>Giving feedback was also beneficial. I was forced to provide honest thoughts and feelings about pairing sessions, which were almost always good experiences. There were occasions where I felt that someone I had paired with was not quite prepared for the session or fully understood that material. I struggled with being direct about these issues, and sometimes simply ignored them. This is something I will continue to work on, because I always appreciated when others were direct with me about where I needed to improve.</p>
				<p>Giving and receiving feedback has certainly made me increasingly concious about how I work with others and how my actions are perceived. Knowing that another person will be providing feedback allows you to think about the pairing experience through their eyes, and often helped eliminate or alleviate problems before they occurred. Although I was not always eager to pair, I'm glad that I did, and I look forward to improving myself through pairing at DBC in the coming weeks.</p>
