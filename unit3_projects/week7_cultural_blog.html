			<h2 class="post-title">Week 7 Cultural Blog: Affirmation and Stereotype Threat</h2>
			<div class="post">
				<p>At the very beginning of Phase 0, I wrote a blog post about which values came to mind when thinking about the happiest times in my life. There were many that I chose, but revisiting them now, the ones that stand out the most are Confidence, Growth, Self-knowledge, Music, and Friendships.</p>
				<p>The first three, Confidence, Growth, and Self-knowledge, are individual traits. These in particular can (and do) help mediate any self-doubt. I am lucky enough to have mostly avoided stereotype threat in my life (as detailed in last week's blog post), but there are many times where I feel as if I am not living up to the expectations that I have for myself. Continuing to improve and building confidence in my abilities are some of the main reasons I am attending DBC. Striving for these values helps me become a better person.</p>
				<p>The last two, Music and Friendships, are social traits. Although I derive a great deal of personal satisfaction from playing/composing/listening to music, my best memories are of making music with others. Many of my strongest friendships have been based or rooted in music. I know that DBC is going to be extremely hectic, and becoming a developer will require a lifetime of learning and dedication. However, I know that I will never be truly happy without music in my life, and I will need to find time to break away from the everyday noise in order to make some of my own.</p>
				<p>I am looking forward to joining the people I have been getting to know in just a few short weeks. DBC seems like just the place to develop not only the skills to become a developer, but also the traits and friendships necessary for a fulfilling career.</p>
