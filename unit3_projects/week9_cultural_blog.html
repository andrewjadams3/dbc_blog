			<h2 class="post-title">Week 9 Cultural Blog: Thinking & Learning Styles</h2>
			<div class="post">
				<p>During my prep phase in the beginning of March (has it been that long already?) I was asked to determine my <a href="http://web.cortland.edu/andersmd/learning/gregorc.htm" target="_blank">Gregorc Thinking Style</a>. After testing myself, I found I strongly idetified with Abstract Sequential and Concrete Random forms of thought. The attributes of these two styles describe me pretty well, but it was the weaknesses that stood out more than anything. Specifically: "being forced to work with those of differing views", "expressing their emotions", and "restrictions and limitations".</p>
				<p>My cultural <a href="week8_cultural_blog.html" target="_blank">blog post last week</a> highlighted my thoughts and struggles with pairing during Phase 0. Although it's not easy for me, I have learned a lot about collaborating with others during my time as a teacher, and my pairing sessions have been successful and enjoyable as a result of that.</p>
				<p>However, even working alone, I have found that I don't always enjoy the restrictions put on some of the assignments. I often find myself re-writing provided tests, modifying instructions to fit how I believe problems should be solved, and making my own judegements about which areas need the most attention. While this can sometimes be beneficial and enhance my learning, I know there are also times where I am skipping over material simply because I chose to. I know that in work environments, following specifications from co-workers and clients is absolutely required, meaning that I need to be able to complete instructions as-written - sometimes even if I believe I have a better approach or implementation. Finding a balance between allowing myself to be creative and completing work will be a focus of mine while at DBC.</p>
				<p>I am also still working towards adopting a total growth mindset. In some areas, such as obstacles and challenges, I feel that I am already fairly strong. I almost always enjoy the work given to me, and I can tell that I am improving every day because of it. However, I still have a tendency to take criticism personally, and and occasionally feel threatened when others succeed in areas I am struggling in. I know that accepting these weaknesses will allow me to grow by following the advice and example of others, and this is something I also hope to address fully in the following months.</p>
