			<h2 class="post-title">Week 4 Cultural Blog: Dealing With Conflict</h2>
			<div class="post">
				<p>Almost all of the conflict in my life has occurred between myself and those who I've dated or been romantically involved with. Those situations are too lengthy and complicated to describe in a single blog post, so I'll instead focus on an incident which arose between a good friend and myself as a direct result of one of my relationships.</p>
				<p>I have found that I get along very well with most people, and I do my best to mitigate or avoid conflict. Usually this is a good thing, but sometimes it isn't. When I was a sophomore in college, I became involved in my first serious, long-term relationship. I began spending a lot of time with this girl, and not doing a whole lot of anything else. I was extremely happy, but I was oblivious to the fact that I was alienating my friends. More specifically, I stopped spending any time at all with my roommate, who had been my best friend all through high school and my freshman year in college. He, like me, preferred to avoid conflict or discussing emotions, so the fact that our friendship was falling apart was never discussed.</p>
				<p>One evening, I received a call from him. He informed me very bluntly that he 1: was going to study abroad next semester and was moving out in a few weeks, and 2: had just signed a lease on a different apartment with a different group of friends for the following year when he returned. It took me a few seconds to digest this information, but I'm ashamed to admit that my initial reaction was to lash out. I remember asking, "what the hell am I supposed to do?". He just replied, "I don't know, sorry man", and hung up.</p>
				<p>There were several days where I was initially quite angry. I felt like he had completely abandoned me, and that it was all his fault. I slowly began to realize, though, that I was the one who had abandoned him long before. At this point, I wish I had gone and apologized, and let him know that I never meant to turn my back on him. But I didn't. My attitude slowly turned on the compass of shame from "attack other" to "avoidance." I denied that there was even a problem, told myself that I didn't need him as a friend, and moved on with my life.</p>
				<p>While he was out of the country, I would periodically think of what I could have done different, and luckily, the girl I was dating was much more open with her emotions than I was. She helped me emerge from denial, and encouraged me to do everything I could to repair the relationship. When my friend returned that summer, I made a point (after a few drinks) to open up and apologize for abandoning the friendship, and let him know that I in no way blamed him for moving out. He was equally as apologetic, and we have remained good friends ever since.</p>
				<p>This particular friend lives in Chicago now, and I am excited to see him again when I move up this summer. Making the decision to admit fault and repair our friendship was one of the best that I've made. I learned that viewing a situation from another person's perspective before jumping to emotional conclusions is almost always the best approach. I'm lucky that I didn't destroy a strong friendship by being stubborn, and I have learned to truly value the friendships that I have.</p>
