			<h2 class="post-title">Week 6 Cultural Blog: Stereotype Threat</h2>
			<div class="post">
				<p>Stereotype threat is a term which was coined by Dr. Claude Steele in the mid-ninteties. During this time, Dr. Steele had begun to notice a pattern of underachievement in black college students. Compared to white students with the same preparedness, socio-economic backgrounds, and ACT scores, black students still had higher dropout rates and lower GPAs. After researching this phenomenon, Dr. Steele attributed stereotype threat, the risk of confirming negative stereotypes about one's group, as one of the predominant factors.</p>
				<p>Growing up as an upper-middle class white male in a wealthy suburban area, I did not experience stereotype threat in the previously described sense. The most negative stereotype ever attributed to me was 'band geek' (which I fully embraced by going on to become a band teacher). In fact, if anything, I may have experienced stereotype threat in a positive sense! Because of the excellent teachers and resources available to us, my classmates (almost all white) and I were expected to perform well in school, go to college, and lead successful lives. An extremely high percentage of my classmates attended college, and simply anecodtally, most have graduated and started careers. This seems to me that we have confirmed our white, suburban stereotypes.</p>
				<p>While my friends and I may have benefitted in this way, it is more than understandable how someone could just as easily be negatively affected by stereotype threat. While black college students may have been an initial observation, there have been numerous other studies which focused on other racial minorities, women, homosexuals, and other groups with negative stereotypes.</p>
				<p>As an educator, I was taught to be aware of these stereotypes, and more importantly, to ignore them. In my classrooms, I've encountered a diverse array of students, and have always done my best teach to each student's actual abilities rather than their perceived abilities. While this may seem like a simple concept, preconceived notions can be difficult to look past. Stereotypes aren't always as simple as simple as race or gender. Clothing choices, friend choices, and even seating choices can affect how a student is perceived, and being able to resist judgement can make a huge difference in how a teacher engages with a student.</p>
				<p>Negative stereotypes can be easily be reinforced when unfair judgements are rendered. I believe one of the best weapons to combat stereotype threat is to remove judgement at an early age, and allow fair opportunities for each person. I'm happy that DBC is taking strides in this direction, and I'm looking forward to learn in such a positive environment.</p>
